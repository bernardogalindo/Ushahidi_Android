You can use ant, Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, or pretty much any IDE
to compile the app. Before building, you should ensure that:

1) You've read <white-labeled-app/>`libs/readme.txt' and have placed the necessary
   JARs into the `libs' directory.

2) Your Eclipse/IDEA/ant/etc. project targets API level 14 or
   higher.

Forgetting to do either of these will result in compile errors.
